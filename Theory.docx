Example questions
[ Do older people have a higher risk of getting heart disease? 
What is the difference in the distribution of ages for people with 
and without heart disease? ]

As seen from figure 1 bottom right graph (subplot 6,2,12), 
older people in the age group of 55 to 60 have a relatively higher risk of getting a heart disease 
compared to other age group (e.g. in age group 40-45, 45-50, 50-55).


[Which gender has a higher risk of getting heart disease? 
What is the probability for a male/female to get heart disease?]

As seen from figure 1 bottom left graph(subplot 6,2,11),
90% of those suffering from heart diseases is male.
Therefore it is safe to conclude that a male has a 
relatively higher risk of getting a heart disease.


[What kind of test results show more indication that a patient has heart disease? What
is the difference in the test results for patients with and without heart disease?]

Potentially, lowered ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, having asymptomatic type chest pain
higher left ventricular hypertrophy ,lower number of major vessel coloured by fluoroscopy
flat slope of peak exercise ST segment, increased reversable defect of thallium stress test and
an presence of exercise induced angina.
However, the symptoms are not definitive of heart diseases but the likelihood of one.
